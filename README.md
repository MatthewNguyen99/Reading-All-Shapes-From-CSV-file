# Reading-All-Shapes-From-CSV-file

Create a program that is capable of reading in the contents of a csv file.

This csv file holds information about various different regular polygons
and circles.  Each entry in the csv file holds the name of the shape and the
length of it's side, or in the case of a circle, it's radius.  You should be
able to calculate the perimeter and area of these regular polygons.

eg contents of the csv

          square,5
          pentagon,3
          triangle,2.5
          circle,2

Your program should output the following:

      Shape 1 is a square, with side length 5,
      having a perimeter of 20 and an area of 25 units square.
      ...
      ...
      Shape 4 is a circle, with a radius of 2,
      having a perimeter of 12.57 and an area of 12.57 units square.

Your solution should ideally use objects and classes,
and some unit testing.  You don't need to adopt a unit
test framework, just the basics to feel like you have decent coverage.
